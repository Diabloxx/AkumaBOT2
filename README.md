# AkumaBOT (USING SEMPAIBOT CODE https://github.com/thememesquad/sempaibot)
# it does the same thing, but instead of connecting to osu! it connects to ripple!
A fun, modular discord bot for osu! and other things! :> 

# General functionality
- Reminders! Have the bot send you or others a reminder message in a couple of minutes or at a certain time or date!
- A permission system (so people can't mess with the bot if you don't want them to).
- Ignore list (same reason as above)
- Tsundere mode, because it's fun.

# osu! module functionality
- Track and announce when one of your friends/follows achieves a top score!
- Show profile information
